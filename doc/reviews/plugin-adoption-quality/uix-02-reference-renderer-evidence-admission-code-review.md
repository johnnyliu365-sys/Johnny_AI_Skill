## Admission and boundary

The candidate descends from the exact approved authority baseline and changes only the declared
private source, focused test and element paths. The worktree is clean after the reviewer-created
candidate commit. No renderer, browser, provider, filesystem, network, process, target,
publication, installation, release or deployment effect was performed.

The implementation-owner focused, regression, strict-type and compile gates returned green. A
separate Terra/xhigh read-only helper attacked the exact candidate and returned findings only; it
did not modify, approve or integrate the candidate. The reviewer then reproduced the findings
against ordinary public constructors with unreduced command output.

## Blocking ticket defect

UIR6 requires valid-but-different request identity or approved-content identity to return
`CONTENT_BINDING_MISMATCH`. The frozen evidence variants contain no request reference, brief ID,
approved-content digest or derived binding digest. Reusing one ordinary
`RenderedReferenceEvidence` under two otherwise valid requests with different request refs, brief
IDs and content digests returns `ADMITTED_RENDERED` twice. `CONTENT_BINDING_MISMATCH` is declared
but unreachable.

Adding a comparable binding to the evidence variants changes the ticket-defined public DTO shape.
The implementation owner cannot invent that contract, so this is `TICKET_DEFECT`, not an
implementation correction. Closure revision 01 is non-dispatchable until the owner approves a
revised binding contract.

## Other candidate findings

The same bounded review batch found three additional frozen-contract gaps:

1. `AVAILABLE_AUTHORIZED` plus `ARTIFACT_ONLY` currently returns `ADMITTED_ARTIFACT`; the ticket
   must state explicitly whether artifact fallback is reserved to `UNAVAILABLE` and `DECLINED`.
2. UIR1 requires bounded Unicode metadata to round-trip without normalization, but every opaque
   identifier uses an ASCII-only pattern and rejects the Unicode cell.
3. The implementation accepts undeclared aliases for `renderer_target` and
   `owner_manual_open_acknowledgement`, so the exact DTO shape and extra-field rejection are not
   closed.

The last two are implementation defects once the ticket contract is repaired. The first is an
ambiguity that the revised ticket must close rather than asking the implementation owner to infer
a truth table.

## Reproduced evidence

```text
same evidence + request/content identity A -> ADMITTED_RENDERED
same evidence + request/content identity B -> ADMITTED_RENDERED
AVAILABLE_AUTHORIZED + ARTIFACT_ONLY       -> ADMITTED_ARTIFACT
bounded Unicode request identity           -> ValidationError/string_pattern_mismatch
declared_renderer_target alias              -> accepted
owner_manual_open_acknowledged alias        -> accepted

focused                                     7 passed
UIX-01/workflow regression                  68 passed, 216 subtests passed
mypy --strict                               Success: no issues found in 2 source files
compileall                                  exit 0
git diff --check                            clean
```

The green suite does not discharge the missing discriminating cells. Because review admission is
blocked by a ticket defect, no reviewer counter-mutation or document-mutation integration was
performed.

## Conclusion and route

Final conclusion: `BLOCKED / TICKET_DEFECT`. Candidate
`faf3d05e07f83a8c7804313b4d3435d01da338b0` remains only preserved evidence on its implementation
branch and must not enter `main`.

The control plane must propose one revised closure that adds an evidence-to-request/content
binding, closes the authorized-artifact truth-table cell, admits bounded Unicode without
normalization and rejects undeclared aliases. Exact owner approval is required before the same
implementation owner receives one additive correction.
